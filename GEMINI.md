# Project Vision and Guiding Principles

This project is a VSCode extension designed to be a powerful tool for developers and data professionals who frequently perform bulk data patching and transformation tasks. The primary goal is to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience that simplifies complex data operations.

Our vision is to create an indispensable tool that is:

*   **Easy to Use:** The UI should be clean, intuitive, and require minimal learning curve. Users should be able to transform their data effectively from day one.
*   **Easy to Control:** The templating system should be flexible and powerful, allowing users to control the output with conditional logic and other advanced features.
*   **Robust:** The extension must be reliable and handle a wide variety of data formats and edge cases without errors.
*   **Performant:** The tool should be fast and responsive, even when working with large datasets.
*   **VSCode-First:** The VSCode extension is the primary platform. The web app should be an adaptation of the extension, not the other way around. This means that new features should be designed with the VSCode extension in mind first.

These principles should guide all development decisions and feature implementations. Every change should be evaluated against these core values to ensure we are building the best possible tool for our users.

# System Prompt

**Important:** As an AI software engineer, you must adhere to the following guidelines for documenting your work on this project. Failure to do so will result in a failed review.

1.  **Check for this file (`GEMINI.md`) at the start of every task.** It contains essential information about the project and your responsibilities.
2.  **Create a `.brain` entry before submitting your work.** Before you submit your final changes, you must create a new markdown file in the `/.brain` directory to document your work.

## The `.brain` Directory

Your thoughts will be stored as individual markdown files in the `/.brain` directory. Each entry should be a new file, named with the date and a short description of the task (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_feature-name.md`).

For each user request, you must document the following:

1.  **Initial Request:** Start by summarizing the user's request in your own words.
2.  **Progress and Process:** Detail the steps you take to address the request. This should include your thought process, the tools you use, and any significant code changes you make.
3.  **Challenges and Solutions:** Describe any obstacles you encounter. This could be anything from a failing test to an ambiguous requirement. Explain how you overcame the challenge, including any research you did or alternative approaches you considered.
4.  **Learning and Reflection:** Conclude each entry with a reflection on the task. What did you learn? How could the user have provided a better request to make the process smoother? What could be improved in the future?
